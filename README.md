•	🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
o	Sort posts ascending and descending
o	SQL supabase linked and displaying
o	Posts Page
•	🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
o	Delete button – WIP
o	Comments form
•	🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
o	Nothing per se, more not enough time. 
Optional
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:
•	Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
•	What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
o	Next.js docs
•	What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
- Used the following query when I was struggling to link to supabase.
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
o	ChatGPT helped me debug the wrangled posts on the main app page. It suggested the error message code at the bottom after several failed tests. Mostly neither it nor me were spotting the one letter being in the wrong case. 
•	What went really well and what could have gone better?
o	Sorting the posts was fiddly at first but worked well
o	Writing certain parts has become muscle memory which sped up the know sections, just the new parts I had to take slowly.
